## ‚ùå My failed attempts to get data

 - Use Amadeus without researching properly that their rail API is enterprise level.
 - Use puppeteer to get data from bahn.expert/routing
 - User bahn.expert/routing internal api to get data
 - Use trainline API by reverse-engineering which does not work as it shows 401
 - Using puppeteer on trainline to get data which did not.
 - After running on localhost, the internal DB API failed on cloud deployments, which required some creative engineering.

## ‚úÖ My successful attempt.

 - Used DB Internal api to get the result and show it.
 - Parse the results into objects and extract relevant information relating to the project.
 - Reverse-engineered to get the internal API and make it work with Nuxt.
 - Set up a reverse proxy server on a machine that me and my friends use for video game server hosting, hosted my proxy server there and exposed a single API which gets us the response.
 - In the project, change the code to actually call the proxy server and get the result instead of calling the API itself.
 - Used ngrok to establish a reverse proxy.

## File Comments

 - Index.vue is the main display page of the app that displays the form and calls the API to get search result from Hamburg To Amsterdam (one-way), and Amsterdam to Hamburg (roundtrip).
 - Then redirects the user to another page that is results.vue
 - Results.vue displays the trips, offer client-side rendering, and also offers sort by Price, Duration, Least Transfer Changes.
 - Has a GoBack to redirect back to Index.vue.
 - /server/api contains two api files that are being used.
 - /server/api/trainline contains three files which were being tested to get data (Puppeteer & API calls)
 - /layouts/default.vue contains the Header of the Project.
 - /composables contains another api call that was being tested for Location search.
 - /assets/css/tailwind.css contains the configuration for tailwind in the project.
